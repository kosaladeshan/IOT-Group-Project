## Overview
The Smart Waste Management System is designed to efficiently manage waste collection by utilizing IoT technology. It employs an Arduino Uno board, ESP32 DevKit V1 module, ultrasonic sensor, and a 20 kg load cell to monitor waste weight and bin fill levels. The system includes LED indicators for visual feedback on bin fill levels and a web interface for real-time monitoring and data collection.

## Components
- Arduino Uno board
- ESP32 DevKit V1 module
- Ultrasonic sensor
- 20 kg load cell
- LEDs (White, Green, Yellow, Red)




## Features
- Real-time monitoring of waste weight and bin fill levels
- LED indicators for easy visual feedback
- Web interface for remote monitoring and data collection
- Data aggregation for yearly analysis

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: PHP
- Database: [MY SQL, XAMPP Server]
- Arduino

## Installation
1. Connect the Arduino Uno board, ESP32 DevKit V1 module, ultrasonic sensor, and load cell according to the provided schematic.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno board.
3. Set up the backend server with PHP and the specified database technology.
4. Deploy the frontend HTML and CSS files to a web server.

## Usage
1. Power on the system.
2. Access the web interface to monitor waste weight and bin fill levels.
3. LED indicators will display the fill level status in real time.
4. Data is collected and stored for future analysis.
